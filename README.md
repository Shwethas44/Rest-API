When a client wants to access our data, they do so through an API, and so a communication is established.
The client makes an HTTP request using the HTTP protocol. When the API receives this request, it processes it and then sends an HTTP response. These messages have a structure and a basic structure is given below:
•	Endpoint: Address where API is hosted on the server. 
•	Resources: Represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the server.
